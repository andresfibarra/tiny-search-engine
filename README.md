### Overview

Code to create a tiny version of google. The program is split in three parts: crawler, indexer, and querier. 

Crawler crawls the local dartmouth web server and creates local files with information on the pages. 

Indexer views the files created by crawler and creates an index of the words found in it. 

Querier takes input from the user to return the files that match the user's queries, ranked according to word frequencies
